# **RAG Applications with LLMs**

## **Description**  
This repository contains projects and tools for building and deploying **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** applications leveraging **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. RAG combines the power of LLMs with external knowledge sources to deliver accurate, context-aware, and scalable solutions for various use cases.

## **Key Features**  
- **End-to-End RAG Pipelines**: Pre-built and customizable workflows for integrating retrieval systems with LLMs.  
- **Knowledge Base Integration**: Support for CSV, databases, APIs, and document stores (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, Elasticsearch).  
- **Pretrained LLMs**: Leverages state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4, OpenAI API, and Hugging Face models.  
- **Retrieval Methods**: Includes dense embeddings with FAISS, BM25 for sparse retrieval, and hybrid approaches.  
- **Custom Embedding Models**: Tools for generating and fine-tuning embeddings for domain-specific data.  
- **Error Analysis & Evaluation**: Metrics for assessing retrieval and generation quality.  
- **Flexible Deployment**: Pipelines ready for local, cloud, and edge environments.

## **Use Cases**  
- **Customer Insights**: Analyze and predict customer behavior with structured data like sales and segmentation.  
- **Product Recommendations**: Generate personalized offers using real-time retrieval-augmented insights.  
- **Document QA**: Enhance document search and question answering with LLM-backed natural language capabilities.  
- **Content Generation**: Automate summaries, reports, and responses with accurate, retrieved context.
