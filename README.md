# RAG-LLM
This repository contains projects and tools for building and deploying Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). RAG combines the power of LLMs with external knowledge sources to deliver accurate, context-aware, and scalable solutions for various use cases.

Key Features
End-to-End RAG Pipelines: Pre-built and customizable workflows for integrating retrieval systems with LLMs.
Knowledge Base Integration: Support for CSV, databases, APIs, and document stores (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, Elasticsearch).
Pretrained LLMs: Leverages state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4, OpenAI API, and Hugging Face models.
Retrieval Methods: Includes dense embeddings with FAISS, BM25 for sparse retrieval, and hybrid approaches.
Custom Embedding Models: Tools for generating and fine-tuning embeddings for domain-specific data.
Error Analysis & Evaluation: Metrics for assessing retrieval and generation quality.
Flexible Deployment: Pipelines ready for local, cloud, and edge environments.
Use Cases
Customer Insights: Analyze and predict customer behavior with structured data like sales and segmentation.
Product Recommendations: Generate personalized offers using real-time retrieval-augmented insights.
Document QA: Enhance document search and question answering with LLM-backed natural language capabilities.
Content Generation: Automate summaries, reports, and responses with accurate, retrieved context.
Structure
/pipelines: Ready-to-use RAG pipelines for common tasks.
/models: Scripts for fine-tuning and using pretrained embedding models.
/retrieval: Code for integrating vector databases and implementing retrieval algorithms.
/evaluation: Tools for benchmarking and analyzing RAG performance.
/deployment: Scripts and guidelines for deploying on various platforms (e.g., Flask, FastAPI, Docker).
