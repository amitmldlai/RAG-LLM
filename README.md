# **RAG Applications with LLMs**

## **Description**  
This repository contains projects and tools for building and deploying **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** applications leveraging **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. RAG combines the power of LLMs with external knowledge sources to deliver accurate, context-aware, and scalable solutions for various use cases.

---

## **Key Features**  
- **End-to-End RAG Pipelines**: Pre-built and customizable workflows for integrating retrieval systems with LLMs.  
- **Knowledge Base Integration**: Support for CSV, databases, APIs, and document stores (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, Elasticsearch).  
- **Pretrained LLMs**: Leverages state-of-the-art LLMs such as Gemini, OpenAI API, Claude,Hugging Face models etc.  
- **Retrieval Methods**: Includes dense embeddings with FAISS, BM25 for sparse retrieval, and hybrid approaches.  
- **Custom Embedding Models**: Tools for generating and fine-tuning embeddings for domain-specific data.
