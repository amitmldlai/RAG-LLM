three months ended March 31, 2021, and 2022.\n\n1. **Income Tax Expense/Benefit**:\n- For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the income tax expense was $185 million.\n- For the three months ended March 31, 2022, the income tax benefit was $(232) million.\n- The 2021 tax expense was mainly due to current tax on foreign earnings and deferred U.S. tax impacts from the sale of the ATG Business, offset by U.S. losses.\n- The 2022 tax benefit was primarily due to deferred U.S. tax impacts related to investments in companies like Grab, Aurora, Didi, and Zomato, along with U.S. losses, offset by current tax on foreign earnings.\n\n2. **Unrecognized Tax Benefits**:\n- In 2022, the gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by an immaterial amount, which would not affect the effective tax rate due to a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets.\n- The company is subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions and is under examination by various tax authorities.\n\n3. **Net Income (Loss) Per Share**:\n- Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.\n- Diluted net loss per share includes the effect of potential dilutive common stock, using the treasury stock method or if-converted method as applicable.\n\nOverall, the report highlights the company's tax positions and calculations related to net income (loss) per share for the specified periods.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1551, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}",

insights into Uber Technologies, Inc.'s exposure to various market risks, including interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency risk.\n\n1. **Interest Rate Risk**: Uber's exposure primarily relates to its floating rate loans (2025 and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities). A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not materially affect financial results. However, a 100 basis point increase would decrease the fair value of fixed-rate notes by $289 million as of March 31, 2022.\n\n2. **Investment Risk**: Uber aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity needs. As of March 31, 2022, it had $7.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents. The company does not engage in trading or speculative investments. A 100 basis point change in interest rates would not materially affect financial results, but investments in privately-held companies may increase volatility in net income due to valuation changes.\n\n3. **Foreign Currency Risk**: Uber operates globally, exposing it to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Revenue and expenses in foreign currencies can impact future results when expressed in U.S. dollars. The company has diversified revenue across regions, which partially mitigates this risk. Future hedging strategies may be considered to manage foreign currency exchange risk.\n\nThe document also mentions the company's disclosure controls and procedures, ensuring compliance with SEC regulations.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1467, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e8b770c5-8271-42dd-b49f-ad345cc51fe3": {"__data__": {"id_": "e8b770c5-8271-42dd-b49f-ad345cc51fe3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ef3bab33-6bad-4aa9-9b01-d316876d66b3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4103f3c4cb49be658ef9ed023ff41ce571e262df7ff0ee2df634e46e242b8ae8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The document discusses the effectiveness of Uber's disclosure controls and procedures, as evaluated by the company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.

The company must comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which involves annual management reports and independent audits of internal controls.\n\n3. **Challenges in Compliance**: The process of evaluating and testing internal controls is costly and complex, especially as the company grows.
